		<h1>A Tale of Unknown</h1>
	</div>
	<p class="dia">Trouble drips from this town like blood from a boxer, luscious and bitter. Horses call in mournful whinnies, their owners hidden with upturned cloak hoods. Grey spiraled down from the heavens, drenching upturned surfaces with morose tears and heavy breaths sending the unprotected dancing. You stand at the edge of such a town, rain flooding your eyes. You blink, your lungs hitching and struggling to inflate. Out of the corner of your vision you see guards sticking straightly to the wooden walls that cradled this place. You can cry out for <span class="ch">HELP</span> or <span class="ch">STAY</span> where you are.</p>
